## Technologies Used
* React Native
* Sass

## Future Plans
* Implement React Redux, Unit Testing and Webpack!
* Optimize the app for all devices and screen sizes.
* Add more features and user settings.
* Give the component control directly to user rather than hardcoding the values myself.

## Known Issues
* Application is not optimized for all screen resolutions. Default supported resolution is 1920x1080.
* Apples stay constant on the screen while tree performs its shaking animation.
* Location of the falling apples change when the button is pressed. This occurs because the Sass reinitiates the component.
* Apples appear poorly on the basket and stack on top of each other. 
* Clicking on the button constantly (twenty clicks in a row! what are you a maniac?) will cause the apple collected count on the screen go crazy!
