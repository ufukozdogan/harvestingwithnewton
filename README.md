# Harvesting With Newton

## Explanation

Sample text

## Known Issues
* Application is not optimized for all screen resolutions. Default supported resolution is 1920x1080.
* Apples stay constant on the screen while tree performs its shaking animation.
* Location of the falling apples change when the button is pressed. This occurs because the Sass reinitiates the component.
* Apples appear poorly on the basket and stack on top of each other. 
* Clicking on the button constantly (twenty clicks in a row! what are you a maniac?) will cause the apple collected count on the screen go crazy!
